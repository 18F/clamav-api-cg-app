# ClamAV API CG App

## Why this project

This project aims to create a deployable cloud.gov app that will expose a REST api for scanning files for malware with ClamAV.

It is inspired by, and borrowed heavily from, https://blog.theodo.com/2017/11/implement-antivirus-api-10-min/

This manifest now runs a docker image from https://github.com/ajilaag/clamav-rest

## Setup

This project depends on one deployment variable, which is documented in `vars.yml-template`

`cp vars.yml-template vars.yml`

### Create app

To push the app to cloud.gov:

`cf push --vars-file vars.yml`

or to specify the project yourself:

`cf push --var project="PROJECT_NAME"`

### Configure networking

A [network policy](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-networking.html#create-policies)
is required to route the TCP traffic from your app to the API endpoint on the apps.internal domain

`cf add-network-policy SOURCE_APP --destination-app DESTINATION_APP --protocol tcp --port 9443`
