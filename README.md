# ClamAV API CG App

## Why this project

This project aims to create a deployable cloud.gov app that will expose a REST api for scanning files for malware with ClamAV.

It is inspired by, and borrows heavily from, https://blog.theodo.com/2017/11/implement-antivirus-api-10-min/

This manifest runs docker images from the following two projects:

* [API interface](https://github.com/solita/clamav-rest)
* [ClamAV server](https://github.com/mko-x/docker-clamav)

## Setup

This project depends on one deployment variable, which is documented in `vars.yml-template`

`cp vars.yml-template vars.yml`

### Create apps

To push both apps to cloud.gov:

`cf push --vars-file vars.yml`

or to specify the project yourself:

`cf push --var project="PROJECT_NAME"`

### Configure networking

A [network policy](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/cf-networking.html#create-policies)
is required to route the TCP traffic from the rest app to the clamd server

`cf add-network-policy SOURCE_APP --destination-app DESTINATION_APP --protocol tcp --port 3310`
